Tasks:
1. Featurization / Preprocessing
  - Construct meaningful variable from date and text
  - Binning continuous data or merging bins in categorical data
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
  - A summary to show the data types of each variable (including outcome variable)
  - A correlation plot to show how (continuous) predictors are correlated, aiming to identify highly correlated variables and their comovements
  - A distribution plot to show distributions of each variable, aiming to identify imbalanced/empty count in categorical variable and skewness in continuous variable
  - Quantity-Categorical analysis
  - Clustering methods 
  - Low dimensional embedding
3. Train-Validation split
  - 70:30
4. Missing data (on train data only)
5. Extreme observations / outliers (on train data only)
  - Isolation forest
  - One-Class SVM
  - Robust Kernel-based outlier factor (RKOF)
6. Proposed algorithms
  - Extreme gradient boosting
  - Random forest
  - Support vector machine
  - Logistic regression with class imbalanced techniques
7. Performance evaluation
  - Choose hyperparameters for each model
  - Evaluate performances on test set
  - Discussion on interpretability of models
  - Discussion on assumption of models
  
Remark 1: Wrap 4 - 6 in a pipeline in a separate python file after hyperparameters are validated
Remark 2: Do step 1 in a separate jupyter notebook
Remark 3: Do step 2 in another separate jupyter notebook
Remark 4: Write analysis and findings on jupyter notebooks directly. Later we put all together into a single PDF using Latex.
